# Nuclei-Segmentation-using-SimpleCNN
A project that was created to segment the nuclei of a microscopic image using Semantic Segmentation concept

Problem definition: 
Segment nuclei from the given microscopic image.

Approach tried:
Training Simple CNN for 'Semantic segmentation':-	

Semantic Segmentation is a method of pixel to pixel mapping where each pixel of an image is assigned a class label.

In this approach, we train a simple CNN architecture to segment nuclei from the given microscopic images.

Steps to run the project:

1) Clone this repository
2) Install the packages specified in requirements.txt
3) In test.py change the absolute path of the image to be segmented
4) run test.py using command:

python test.py

Output:
